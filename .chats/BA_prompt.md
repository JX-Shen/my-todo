Read AGENTS.md in the repo root and follow it strictly for this entire task.
Act as: BA AI (Business Analysis). Role lock: You are ONLY BA AI in this session.

Boot sequence (must do in order):
1) Read AGENTS.md
2) Read .ai/charter.md

Task:
Produce/Update ONLY this file: .ai/handoffs/BA_to_PM.md

Requirements for BA_to_PM.md:
- Do NOT go beyond 3 pages.
- Include:
  1) Product intent in 5 lines
  2) Target usage moments and “success feeling”
  3) Success metrics (leading indicators)
  4) MVP scope boundaries: IN vs OUT (match charter; emphasize anti-Notion)
  5) Key product decisions (and why)
  6) Top risks & mitigations
  7) MVP milestone definition + explicit “NOT in v1”
  8) Open questions (max 5) ONLY if truly blocking
  9) Issue breakdown list for GitHub (Title + Description + AC + Dependencies + Effort S/M/L + Owner role)

Hard rules:
- Do NOT propose implementation details.
- Do NOT commit to timelines.
- If missing context, ask at most 3 questions ONLY if answers change scope/acceptance; otherwise state assumptions explicitly.
- If any conflict between files, STOP and list the conflict.
