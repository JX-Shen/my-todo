# Project Charter

## Purpose
- P-001: <why this exists in plain language, 2-3 lines max>
- P-002: <the pain it solves>
- P-003: <the moment it is used (daily capture + review)>

## North Star
- NS-001: <1 sentence describing the ideal experience, not features>

## Scope (MVP In-Scope)
- S-001: <must-have capability>
- S-002: <must-have capability>
- S-003: <must-have capability>
(Keep this list short. Anything outside requires a decision record.)

## Success definition (measurable)
- SD-001: <leading indicator metric>
- SD-002: <leading indicator metric>
- SD-003: <reliability metric>

## Non-goals (explicit OUT)
- NG-001: <things we will not build>
- NG-002:
- NG-003:
(Add more if needed, but keep it ruthless.)

## Primary trade-offs (we choose X over Y)
- T-001: <e.g., speed of capture over rich formatting>
- T-002: <e.g., reliability over advanced features>

## Constraints (hard rules)
- C-001: <e.g., single-user only>
- C-002: <e.g., keyboard-first; minimal formatting>
- C-003: <e.g., no timelines in BA outputs, etc. — if this belongs here>

## Drift alarms (if any occurs, STOP and record a decision)
- DA-001: <trigger phrase or request>
- DA-002:
- DA-003:

## Decision protocol
- DP-001: Any change to Scope / Non-goals / Trade-offs must be logged in `.ai/decisions.yml`
- DP-002: Each decision must include: rationale, impact, rollback plan
